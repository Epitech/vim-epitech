# epitech-emacs
Vim configuration for Epitech students.

## Installation
- To install, run `./install.sh`

## Post-scriptum
Unfortunately vim does not really supports system wide installation but you can "enable it" by doing this : 

- Copy the epitech file in a folder such as : `/etc/vim/epitech` (for example)
- Make sure each user has `source /path_to_custom.vim` in their ~/.vimrc
